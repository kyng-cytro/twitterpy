please not that you have to have developer access on twitter to be able to run this script
everything else is simplified inside the script. I understand the difficulty some coders like me undergo to replicate things like this so I've explained everybit.
you can leave a message here for me or contact me on twitter (smiles) @iammahveotm if you're experiencing any issue. I'd respond as fast as I can!
So have fun and stay safe, I love youuuuuu!!!!
