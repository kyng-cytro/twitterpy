# twitterpy
please note that you have to have developer access on twitter to be able to run this script
you also need to have tweepy installed, it's pretty much simple and extensively explained on their website
everything else is simplified in the script. I understand the difficulty some coders like me go through to replicate things like this so I've explained everybit.
you can leave a message here for me or contact me on twitter (smiles) @iammahveotm if you're experiencing any issue. I'd respond as fast as I can!
So have fun and stay safe, I love youuuuuu!!!!
